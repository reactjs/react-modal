This page describes some of react-modal's accessibility-oriented features, along with their configuration options. The app element It is important for users of screenreaders that other page content be hidden (via the aria-hidden attribute) while the modal is open. To allow react-modal to do this, you should call Modal.setAppElement with a query selector identifying the root of your app. For example, if your app content is located inside an element with the ID root , you could place the following call somewhere in your code before any modals are opened: Modal.setAppElement('#root'); You can also pass a DOM element directly, so that the above example could be rewritten: Modal.setAppElement(document.getElementById('root')); Using a selector that matches multiple elements or passing a list of DOM elements will hide all of the elements. Note that this list won't be automatically pruned if elements are removed from the DOM, so you may want to call Modal.setAppElement when any such changes are made, or pass a live HTMLCollection as the value. If you are already applying the aria-hidden attribute to your app content through other means, you can pass the ariaHideApp={false} prop to your modal to avoid getting a warning that your app element is not specified. Using Modal.setAppElement will not embed react-modal into your react app as a descendent component. It will just help boost up the app accessiblity. Keyboard navigation When the modal is opened, it restricts keyboard navigation using the tab key to elements within the modal content. This ensures that elements outside the modal (which are not visible while the modal is open) do not receive focus unexpectedly. By default, when the modal is closed, focus will be restored to the element that was focused before the modal was opened. To disable this behavior, you can pass the shouldReturnFocusAfterClose={false} prop to your modal. The modal can be closed using the escape key, unless the shouldCloseOnEsc={false} prop is passed. Disabling this behavior may cause accessibility issues for keyboard users, however, so it is not recommended. ARIA attributes Besides the aria-hidden attribute which is applied to the app element when the modal is shown, there are many other ARIA attributes which you can use to make your app more accessible. A complete list of ARIA attributes can be found in the ARIA specification . One ARIA attribute is given a dedicated prop by react-modal: you should use the contentLabel prop to provide a label for the modal content (via aria-label ) if there is no visible label on the screen. If the modal is already labeled with visible text, you should specify the element including the label with the aria-labelledby attribute using the aria prop described below. To pass other ARIA attributes to your modal, you can use the aria prop, which accepts an object whose keys are the attributes you want to set (without the leading aria- prefix). For example, you could have an alert modal with a title as well as a longer description: <Modal isOpen= {modalIsOpen} aria= {{ labelledby: \"heading\", describedby: \"full_description\" }} > <h1 id= \"heading\" > Alert </h1> <div id= \"full_description\" > <p> Description goes here. </p> </div> </Modal>","title":"Accessibility"},{"location":"accessibility/#the-app-element","text":"It is important for users of screenreaders that other page content be hidden (via the aria-hidden attribute) while the modal is open.

For the content and overlay You can use the className and overlayClassName props to control the CSS classes that are applied to the modal content and the overlay, respectively. Each of these props may be a single string containing the class name to apply to the component. Alternatively, you may pass an object with the base , afterOpen and beforeClose keys, where the value corresponding to each key is a class name. The base class will always be applied to the component, the afterOpen class will be applied after the modal has been opened and the beforeClose class will be applied after the modal has requested to be closed (e.g. when the user presses the escape key or clicks on the overlay). Please note that the beforeClose class will have no effect unless the closeTimeoutMS prop is set to a non-zero value, since otherwise the modal will be closed immediately when requested. Thus, if you are using the afterOpen and beforeClose classes to provide transitions, you may want to set closeTimeoutMS to the length (in milliseconds) of your closing transition. If you specify className , the default content styles will not be applied. Likewise, if you specify overlayClassName , the default overlay styles will not be applied. If no class names are specified for the overlay, the default classes ReactModal__Overlay , ReactModal__Overlay--after-open and ReactModal__Overlay--before-close will be applied; the default classes for the content use the analogous prefix ReactModal__Content . Please note that any styles applied using these default classes will not override the default styles as they would if specified using the className or overlayClassName props. For the document.body and html tag You can override the default class that is added to document.body when the modal is open by defining a property bodyOpenClassName . The bodyOpenClassName prop must be a constant string ; otherwise, we would require a complex system to manage which class name should be added to or removed from document.body from which modal (if using multiple modals simultaneously).

By default, there are no styles applied to the portal itself.","title":"For the entire portal"},{"location":"styles/transitions/","text":"Using CSS classes , it is possible to implement transitions for when the modal is opened or closed. By placing the following CSS somewhere in your project's styles, you can make the modal content fade in when it is opened and fade out when it is closed: . ReactModal__Overlay { opacity : 0 ; transition : opacity 2000 ms ease-in-out ; } . ReactModal__Overlay--after-open { opacity : 1 ; } . ReactModal__Overlay--before-close { opacity : 0 ; } The above example will apply the fade transition globally, affecting all modals whose afterOpen and beforeClose classes have not been set via the className prop. To apply the transition to one modal only, you can change the above class names and pass an object to your modal's className prop as described in the previous section . In order for the fade transition to work, you need to inform the <Modal /> about the transition time required for the animation. Like this < Modal closeTimeoutMS = { 2000 } /> closeTimeoutMS is expressed in milliseconds. The closeTimeoutMS value and the value used in CSS or style prop passed to <Modal /> needs to be the same. Warning: if you are using React 16 , the close transition works only if you use the isOpen prop to toggle the visibility of the modal. Do not conditionally render the <Modal /> . Instead of this { this . state . showModal && < Modal closeTimeoutMS = { 200 } isOpen contentLabel = \"modal\" onRequestClose = {() => this . toggleModal ()} > < h2 > Add modal content here < /h2> < /Modal> } Do this { < Modal closeTimeoutMS = { 200 } isOpen = { this . state . showModal } contentLabel = \"modal\" onRequestClose = {() => this . toggleModal ()} > < h2 > Add modal content here < /h2> < /Modal> } React Modal has adopted the stable Portal API as exposed in React 16. And createProtal API from React 16 no longer allow developers to intervene the unmounting of the portal component.","title":"Transitions"},{"location":"testing/","text":"Testing When using React Test Utils with this library, here are some things to keep in mind: You need to set isOpen={true} on the modal component for it to render its children.
